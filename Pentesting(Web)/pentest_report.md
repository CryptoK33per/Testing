# 🔒 Redacted Web Application Pentest Report
*All sensitive host and IP information has been redacted for responsible disclosure.*

---

## 🌐 Host Information
**Host Name:** `idontknow.com`

> _After a few sleepless nights, too much coffee, and a suspiciously intimate relationship with Burp Suite, I finally dug deep enough to make this report possible._

---

## 🧠 Objective
To perform a black-box penetration test of a public web application in order to uncover misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and sensitive data exposure without prior access.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Recon**: `dnsrecon`, `whois`, `dig`
- **Port Scanning**: `nmap`
- **Directory Fuzzing**: `dirb`, `dirsearch`, `gobuster`
- **Web Exploitation**: `Burp Suite`, CSRF/Clickjacking payloads, manual testing
- **WAF Evasion**: Custom User-Agent rotation, payload obfuscation

---

## 🔍 Recon & Enumeration Summary
- Open ports identified:
  - `21` (FTP)
  - `80` (HTTP)
  - `443` (HTTPS)
- Found internal form submission over **HTTP** handling **PII**, including proof ID upload fields.
- Web template used: **AdminKit**, leading to discovery of admin panel at:
  ```
  /template/adminkit/hidden/admin.login
  ```

> _Yes, they literally left the admin panel behind the digital equivalent of "Do Not Enter" tape. So, of course, I entered._

---

## 🚨 Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. 🔴 Unencrypted Form Submission
- Sensitive data transmitted over HTTP.
- Risk: MITM, credential theft.

### 2. 🔴 Clickjacking
- `X-Frame-Options` set to `SAMEORIGIN`, allowing iframe-based attacks.
- CSP headers not implemented.
- **PoC Payload Code Snippet** (for educational purposes only):
```html
<iframe src="http://dummy.com/sensitive-form" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
```
> _Note: This was just a harmless test payload. The actual exploit involved crafting a fake scam site that redirected users to `login.php` on dummy.com. Once they entered credentials, they were silently reverted to the attacker’s home PC. Kind of like a magic trick, but evil._

### 3. 🔴 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- No CSRF token present in authenticated POST requests.
- Successful manipulation via malicious external form.

### 4. 🔴 IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
- Changed URLs to escalate from user to admin-level access:
  ```
  /customer-login?id=admin
  ```
- No session or role validation.

> _When you can go from customer to admin by changing a number in the URL, you know you're in hacker heaven._

### 5. 🔴 Directory & Sensitive File Exposure
- Accessed hidden files and configuration through WAF bypass + dirbusting.
- Discovered directory traversal leads to configuration leaks.

#### 🛠 Extracted Files (from terminal, green and glorious):
```bash
/etc/php.d/10-opcache.ini
/etc/php.d/20-bz2.ini
/etc/php.d/20-calendar.ini
/etc/php.d/20-ctype.ini
/etc/php.d/20-curl.ini
/etc/php.d/20-dom.ini
```
- These files exposed server configuration, modules, and environment setup.

### 6. 🔴 PHP Info Exposure
- `/phpinfo.php` disclosed full server environment:
  - PHP version
  - Server IP
  - Installed extensions
  - Framework paths and endpoints

---

## 🔐 Admin Panel Access via AdminKit
- Found hidden panel at:
```bash
/template/adminkit/hidden/admin.login
```
- No authentication barrier.
- Default AdminKit template paths intact — poor access control.

> _Moral of the story: never leave your admin panel in plain sight behind an "adminkit" folder. That’s hacker bait 101._

## ✅ Recommendations
| Vulnerability | Suggested Fix |
|---------------|----------------|
| Unencrypted Form | Enforce HTTPS + HSTS |
| Clickjacking | Set `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, add CSP |
| CSRF | Add CSRF tokens + `SameSite` cookies |
| IDOR | Implement RBAC and strict route protection |
| File Exposure | Restrict access to config dirs & use `.htaccess`/web server rules |
| PHP Info | Remove `phpinfo()` files from production |
| AdminKit Panel | Obfuscate route, enforce auth and IP whitelisting |
